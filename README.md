# Compiler-Design

Two parts of Compiler design have been implemented so far, Lexical Analyis and Syntax Analysis. 

Note: The parser also includes source code of tokenizer as the professor required us to submit the entire assignment as one file.

Lexical-Analysis

This application runs an analysis on user given input and determines the output based on the functional requirements, which are mentioned in the requirements file. 

The analyis is done on ASCII characters.


Syntax-Analysis

This application takes tokens created in previos step as an input and creates a Top-Down Parser using grammer mentioned in the parser instructions. 
Top-Down Parser is based upon recursive decent(top to bottom, left to right).

It prints the parse tree in XML format as output for non-terminal and terminal nodes of parse tree.   

The application is written in C++.
