# Compiler-Design

Two parts of Compiler design have been implemented so far, Lexical Analyis and Syntax Analysis. 

Lexical-Analysis

This application runs an analysis on user given input and determines the output based on the functional requirements, which are mentioned in the requirements file. 

The analyis is done on ASCII characters.

The code is written in C++.

Syntax-Analysis

This application takes tokens created in previos step as an input and creates a top-down parser using grammer mentioned in the parser instructions.

It creates the output in XML format for non-terminal and terminal nodes of parse tree.   

The code is written in C++.
